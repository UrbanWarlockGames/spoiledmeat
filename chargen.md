## Attributes
You may upgrade two different attributes by +1 three times (for a total of +6 with no attribute over +3). Then, you add +1 to your class attribute.
- Physical: Might, Agility, Fitness
- Mental: Knowledge, Perception, Willpower

### Random Characters
For a random character: roll 9d6 and assign one result for each attribute (1: -1, 2-3: 0, 4: +1, 6: +2, 6: +3).
For a slightly less random character you can roll 9d8 and assign one result for each attribute (1: -1, 2-4: 0, 5-6: +1, 7: +2, 8: +3).
It is not advised to mix random and point buy characters in the same game.

2. You have 1 Reaction by default and regain your reaction, like other 3 actions, at the start of your turn
3. Stamina is targeted before Health. Once Stamina is depleted, you gain the Tired Condition which gives you a -1 to all saving throws. You may spend Stamina to upgrade a result by one tier at a cost equal to actions used.
4. Some Referees may wish to leave out perception saving throws and leave it up to the players to search areas thoroughly.
5. Roll Morale score when called for Morale checks. A failure results in gaining the Stressed condition, giving a -1 to attack rolls until the end of the encounter; 0 Morale gives the Panicked condition until Morale is restored >0: The only actions you can take are Hide, Move, Take Cover, and Defend. Panicked creatures also gain one level of Noisy (giving a bane on stealth checks)
6. Skill growth chance: Roll a skill growth check as soon as you are aware it is nightfall (base 1 in 10 per used skill, 2 in 5 after a Critical Success; failed growth blocks further attempts that day). On a success, your skill increases by +1. On a failure, nothing happens.

## Skills

### Lore Skills
You have one Background skill for each point you have in Knowledge at character creation. The rating of your Background Skills increases by +1 for every five hit dice you have.
